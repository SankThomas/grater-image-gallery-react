## Refactoring Grater Image Gallery

- Check out the original repository at https://github.com/SankThomas/grater-image-gallery.git

#### Requirements

1. Nodejs installed on your system. Visit (nodejs.org) [https://nodejs.org] to download and install nodejs on your system.
2. Basic understanding of React Hooks, fetching data from an API using React Hooks, and displaying the data.
3. React Developer Tools chrome extension which you can get by visiting the chrome web store. This will give you 2 extra tabs in your chrome developer tools which help while debugging.
4. Tailwindcss CDN. Visit (cdnjs.org) [https://cdnjs.com], search for "tailwindcss" and copy the link tag for the minified css, i.e "...tailwind.min.css"
5. (Optional) Tailwind CSS Intellisense VSCode extension. This is optional because the extension only works if you have installed tailwind in your workspace - follow the link below to the tailwind docs for more information.

- Note that you can install tailwindcss in your workspace if you don't want to use the CDN. Visit [https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation] for a more detailed explanation.
