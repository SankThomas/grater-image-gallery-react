## Refactoring Grater Image Gallery

- Check out the original repository at https://github.com/SankThomas/grater-image-gallery.git

#### Requirements

1. Nodejs installed on your system. Visit (nodejs.org) [https://nodejs.org] to download and install nodejs on your system.
2. Basic understanding of React Hooks, fetching data from an API using React Hooks, and displaying the data.
3. React Developer Tools chrome extension which you can get by visiting the chrome web store. This will give you 2 extra tabs in your chrome developer tools which help while debugging.
4. For this project, we're going to install tailwindcss using npm so that we have access to the Tailwind CSS Intellisense VSCode Extension.
5. (Optional) Tailwind CSS Intellisense VSCode extension. This is optional because the extension only works if you have installed tailwind in your workspace.

- Note: If you don't want to use Tailwind via npm, then you can grab the CDN from [https://cdnjs.com] and copy the <link> tag inside your index.html file in the public folder of your application.
